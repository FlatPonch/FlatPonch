History :

- January 16, 2008 I'm born.
- Rubbed my right eyebrow on the corner of a desk when I was a little kid, and my eyebrows haven't grown back since.
- Got a WiiU in 2015 and got hooked on Splatoon.
- Got a Switch in 2017 (bought it the year it came out so I struggled to get one) and got hooked on Splatoon 2.
- Got my first PC in I don't know how many years (made by Dell) I use it now sometimes (it started out with Windows 10 on it, but now it's Windows 11)
- Entered junior high school in 2020
- Around 2021, I got hooked on Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid and bought a new PC.
- Around the latter half of 2022, Zundamon became my favorite that no one can surpass. Also, I bought my long-sought after Nothing phone (1) and ear (stick).
- I'm currently working in the gadget world, developing software and websites, editing videos and posting them on YouTube, etc. I also play games (mainly VR and Roblox).

I'm a hidden zundamon nanoda!
